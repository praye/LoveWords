# LoveWords
This project, named LoveWords, is developed as our graduation project. Based on Android OS, we are planning to develop an APP for English words learning.  
Including word searching, daily test, word recommending and some other functions, this project aims to provide a clean APP to users without ads.  
Some word dictionaries will be included in our APP for looking up words while APP run in an no-Internet environment. While local dictionaries do not consist the word we search and smartphone could establish internet connection, App would access third part (it may be youdao translation) to get its meaning. We are going to express our appreciation to third part for their help.  
Information will be continously updated.
